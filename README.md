# pantry-db

Small project I wrote to try to interface Python and MySQL directly, back in 2013.

Implements its own menu system with input checking. Probably could've used something like SQLAlchemy and saved myself a huge headache...

Uses Python 2.7. I'm not going to fix it up. Here for historical purposes. Check out my Flask Todo app for an example of how I've improved.

## Requirements

* MySQL server
* Python-MySQL module
